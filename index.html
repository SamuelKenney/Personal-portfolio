            <h2>A little bit about me</h2>
            <p>I am now in the midst of my senior year at Grove City college with a major in Computer Science and Minor in Mathematics. I love using the skills I have learned the past couple of years to build user-centered designed applications that run on cool, clean, efficient code.  <br>
            I am all about breaking down the computer nerd stereotype. My goal is to show that developers can also be designers and have an eye and gift for creating applications that are more than just good code, but also a beautiful product.  <br>
            Scroll below and check out all the things I am interested in and love being a part of. When I am not building and creating you can normally find me riding my 1987 Bridgestone 600 Road bike or making sure I have the right amount of fresh grounds for my pour over.

                <h4><img src="images/html.png">Web Development </h4>
                <p>There is something about developing for the web that has always grabbed my attention. I cannot  stop creating and designing for the web. Having a beautiful page is the different between that next gig or new opportunity. It had better be exactly what you want while being about as beautiful as can be. </p>

            <div id="software-dev" class="col-lg-6">
                <h4><img src="images/tools.png">Software Development </h4>
                <p>Code needs to be "cool, clean, and efficient". The pursuit of writing code that is easily understood, added to, edited, refactored will be a life-long pursuit. Harnessing the power of a computer will be something that will never get old or wear out. It really is possible to have technology make the world a better place. </p>

            <div id="scrum" class="col-lg-6">
                <h4><img src="images/agile.png">Agile</h4>
                <p>Refining the process is what makes the difference between a beautiful solution and some text that people quickly move to their recycle bin. Being a part of scrum has shown me what it takes to have a top-notch result for your hard work. </p>

                <h4><img src="images/lightbulb.png">Entrepreneurship </h4>
                <p>New ideas and ventures have always been a pursuit that has fascinated me. To build something from scratch by blood, sweat, and tears is the way to quickly learn and develop skills as a person and developer. The fruit of that hard labor will always be worth it and give a feeling of pride for knowing that you built something special.  </p>

                <p>Working at PPG was one great experience. For most of my time at school, my interaction with Databases was limited, but then at PPG, I was able to actively contribute and be a member of the Oracle Team. A large task I completed while interning was creating an  Oracle Form with PL/SQL used by Ford and Chrysler in the factory for pallet configurations to streamline shipping process. I then had to opportunity to write a  Linux Bash script that is run monthly to keep internal servers clean and up-to-date resulting in better storage utilization </p>

                <p>Kulike and Soffa is the place where I was first taught Source Contol and so I learned and became adept at using Git and its command line interface. Aquiring that skill in the real world was one of the most valuable as I went on to conitine developing at school. The biggest part of my summer here was fixing a  company tool by updating Tcl script and adding features for faster installation and testing of software. It helped me work on the skill of taking general technical knowledge and applying it to a new technology.</p>

I contributed to a project for a C# Algorithms and Data Structures solutions by implemented an Open Addressing Hash Table using Double Hashing. I had used C# in classes many times but this was using the .NET framework for only backend like functionality. I was able to learn by getting my first pull-request rejected but then was able to have my changes merged in and add to the Open Source Community. </p>
