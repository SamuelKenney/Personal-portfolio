            <h2>A little bit about me</h2>
			<p>I am currently working as a Software Engineer at NetApp on the #1 Data Operating System in the work, ONTAP. I get to work on kernel code and debug issues within the file system. While not deep in the bowls of the operation system I am also <br>
			helping build our RESTful APIs for customers. I am an passionate, energestic engineer that is thrilled when there is a new problem to solve or a new technical idea to learn. <br>

                <p>There is something about developing and problem solving in the kernel that brings to the surface some of the most complex and difficult issues to debug and fix. But that is what makes it some of the most fun! There are few other types of programming that can help someone to grow and mature as an engineer. </p>

                <h4><img src="images/tools.png">Software Development </h4>
                <p>Code needs to be "cool, clean, and efficient". The pursuit of writing code that is easily understood, added to, edited, refactored will be a life-long pursuit. Harnessing the power of a computer will be something that will never get old or wear out. It really is possible to have technology make the world a better place. </p>

                <h4><img src="images/agile.png">Agile</h4>
                <p>Refining the process is what makes the difference between a beautiful solution and some text that people quickly move to their recycle bin. Being a part of scrum has shown me what it takes to have a top-notch result for your hard work. </p>

                <h4><img src="images/lightbulb.png">Entrepreneurship </h4>
                <p>New ideas and ventures have always been a pursuit that has fascinated me. To build something from scratch by blood, sweat, and tears is the way to quickly learn and develop skills as a person and developer. The fruit of that hard labor will always be worth it and give a feeling of pride for knowing that you built something special.  </p>

				<p>I really love working at NetApp. I get to solve  complex, difficult engineering problems within the flagship operating system of NetApp through file-system and kernel level development. On top of that I support continuous integration and regression testing through python modules to validate code fixes which consistently keeps quality of product up. Every day I feel challenged as an engineer and a problem solver. NetApp is a place where I am humbled by all that there is to know but excited by the amazing technology I get to grow by working on</p>

                <p>Working at PPG was one great experience. For most of my time at school, my interaction with Databases was limited, but then at PPG, I was able to actively contribute and be a member of the Oracle Team. A large task I completed while interning was creating an  Oracle Form with PL/SQL used by Ford and Chrysler in the factory for pallet configurations to streamline shipping process. I then had to opportunity to write a  Linux Bash script that is run monthly to keep internal servers clean and up-to-date resulting in better storage utilization </p>

                <p>Kulike and Soffa is the place where I was first taught Source Contol and so I learned and became adept at using Git and its command line interface. Aquiring that skill in the real world was one of the most valuable as I went on to continue developing at school. The biggest part of my summer here was fixing a  company tool by updating Tcl script and adding features for faster installation and testing of software. It helped me work on the skill of taking general technical knowledge and applying it to a new technology.</p>

I contributed to a project for a C# Algorithms and Data Structures solutions by implemented an Open Addressing Hash Table using Double Hashing. I had used C# in classes many times but this was using the .NET framework for only backend like functionality. I was able to learn by getting my first pull-request rejected but then was able to have my changes merged in and add to the Open Source Community. </p>
